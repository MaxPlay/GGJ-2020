## About
"Dougs Ducks" is a medieval smithing simulator, where you as a smith have a supporting role in the great duck wars of 1024 A.D.: Your democratically minded ducks fight against the totalitarian ducks in a huge battle that will later be known as the "Clash of Clans with side dishes". Unfortunately, the weapons and armor of your ducks deteriorates while doing battle, so your ducks will frequently need their equipment repaired to stand a chance. Repair their stuff as quickly as possible and help spread democracy and freedom!
